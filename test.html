  <h3>Welcome to the RDA Element Vocabularies in GitHub</h3>

  <p>As of January 2014 the RDA Element Vocabularies are available in published form in the namespace
    <a href="http://rdaregistry.info">http://rdaregistry.info</a>. This new version of the elements has been
    extensively rearranged and updated to reflect recent decisions by the Joint Steering Committee for the Development
    of RDA (JSC).</p>

  <p>The published vocabularies are currently available in several sets which reflect the underlying FRBR conceptual
    model. There is also a version for library and other users who prefer properties not constrained by FRBR. These
    ‘unconstrained’ elements are in a separate set, but they have the same internal relationships as the elements in
    the ‘constrained’ sets. The links to the published element sets below will take you to a page that will provide direct access to various representations of each Element Set. The number of elements in each set is given in brackets.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/c">Classes</a> (8)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/w">Work properties</a> (232)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/e">Expression properties</a> (236)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/m">Manifestation properties</a> (213)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/i">Item properties</a> (54)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/a">Agent properties</a> (226)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/u">Unconstrained properties</a> (698)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The HTML pages for each Element hosted at the Open Metadata Registry, maintain a balance between human-friendly and machine-friendly identifiers, so you will see a mix
    of identifiers with opaque numerics and more human readable labels. Documentation currently in preparation will
    provide more explanation for these decisions and their intended utility. Note that the constrained elements are
    related to their unconstrained versions so that data created in an RDA application can be re-used by a non-RDA
    application.</p>
  <p>If you discover a problem with the representations of the vocabularies, or have a question, or even wish to engage in a philosophical or practical discussion, please <a href="https://github.com/RDARegistry/RDA-Vocabularies/issues">raise an issue!</a></p>
  <h5>What’s different from the previous version?</h5>

  <p>The work on a draft version began in 2008, and since then a significant amount of discussion and learning has
    occurred. The new RDA Vocabularies reflect that understanding. </p>

  <p>The draft version of the elements available at <a href="http://rdvocab.info">http://rdvocab.info</a> were never
    officially published, so those elements will be deprecated and users and applications redirected to the current
    official versions at <a href="http://rdaregistry.info">http://rdaregistry.info</a>. </p>
  <h5>What about the RDA value vocabularies?</h5>

  <p>The RDA Value Vocabularies agreed by the JSC are published in the original namespace at
    <a href="http://rdvocab.info">http://rdvocab.info</a>. The JSC has no plans to move them to the new namespace, but
    the situation will be reviewed in due course as part of the ongoing development of RDA documentation for users and
    application developers. Any changes will be carried out with minimum disruption and will not affect the semantics
    of the vocabulary concepts and terms.</p>

  <h5>Next Steps</h5>

  <p>The JSC, Metadata Management Associates (MMA), and the American Library Association Publishing division will
    continue to collaborate on extensions and refinements of the RDA element sets and value vocabularies. Some
    additional functionality will be added to the RDA Vocabularies as improvements are made in the OMR software. We
    are always happy to discuss current and future requirements of users or potential users of the vocabularies.</p>
