  h2 Welcome to the RDA Element Vocabularies in GitHub
  p
    | As of January 2014 the RDA Element Vocabularies are available in published form in the namespace 
    a(href='http://rdaregistry.info/') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdaregistry&period;info&sol;
    | &period; This new version of the elements has been 
    | extensively rearranged and updated to reflect recent decisions by the Joint Steering Committee for the Development 
    | of RDA &lpar;JSC&rpar;&period;
  p
    | The published vocabularies are currently available in several sets which reflect the underlying FRBR conceptual
    | model&period; There is also a version for library and other users who prefer properties not constrained by FRBR&period; These
    | &OpenCurlyQuote;unconstrained&rsquor; elements are in a separate set&comma; but they have the same internal relationships as the elements in
    | the &OpenCurlyQuote;constrained&rsquor; sets&period; The links to the published element sets below will take you to a page that will provide direct access to various representations of each Element Set&period; The number of elements in each set is given in parentheses&period;

  p
    | The HTML pages for each Element hosted at the Open Metadata Registry&comma; maintain a balance between human-friendly and machine-friendly identifiers&comma; so you will see a mix
    | of identifiers with opaque numerics and more human readable labels&period; Documentation currently in preparation will
    | provide more explanation for these decisions and their intended utility&period; Note that the constrained elements are
    | related to their unconstrained versions so that data created in an RDA application can be re-used by a non-RDA
    | application&period;
  p
    | If you discover a problem with the representations of the vocabularies&comma; or have a question&comma; or even wish to engage in a philosophical or practical discussion&comma; please 
    a(href='https://github.com/RDARegistry/RDA-Vocabularies/issues') raise an issue&excl;

    h3 What&rsquor;s different from the previous version&quest;
    p
      | The work on a draft version began in 2008&comma; and since then a significant amount of discussion and learning has
      | occurred&period; The new RDA Vocabularies reflect that understanding&period;
    p
      | The draft version of the elements available at 
      a(href='http://rdvocab.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdvocab&period;info
      |  were never
      | officially published&comma; so those elements will be deprecated and users and applications redirected to the current
      | official versions at 
      a(href='http://rdaregistry.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdaregistry&period;info
      | &period;

    h3 What about the RDA value vocabularies&quest;
    p
      | The RDA Value Vocabularies agreed by the JSC are published in the original namespace at 
      a(href='http://rdvocab.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdvocab&period;info/
      | &period; The JSC has no plans to move them to the new namespace&comma; but
      | the situation will be reviewed in due course as part of the ongoing development of RDA documentation for users and
      | application developers&period; Any changes will be carried out with minimum disruption and will not affect the semantics
      | of the vocabulary concepts and terms&period;
.row
    h3 Next Steps
    p
      | The JSC&comma; Metadata Management Associates &lpar;MMA&rpar;&comma; and the American Library Association Publishing division will
      | continue to collaborate on extensions and refinements of the RDA element sets and value vocabularies&period; Some
      | additional functionality will be added to the RDA Vocabularies as improvements are made in the OMR software&period; We
      | are always happy to discuss current and future requirements of users or potential users of the vocabularies&period;
