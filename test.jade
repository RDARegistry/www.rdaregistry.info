      h3 Welcome to the RDA Element Vocabularies in GitHub
      p
        | As of January 2014 the RDA Element Vocabularies are available in published form in the namespace
        a(href='http://rdaregistry.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdaregistry&period;info
        | &period; This new version of the elements has been
        | extensively rearranged and updated to reflect recent decisions by the Joint Steering Committee for the Development
        | of RDA &lpar;JSC&rpar;&period;
      p
        | The published vocabularies are currently available in several sets which reflect the underlying FRBR conceptual
        | model&period; There is also a version for library and other users who prefer properties not constrained by FRBR&period; These
        | &OpenCurlyQuote;unconstrained&rsquor; elements are in a separate set&comma; but they have the same internal relationships as the elements in
        | the &OpenCurlyQuote;constrained&rsquor; sets&period; The links to the published element sets below will take you to a page that will provide direct access to various representations of each Element Set&period; The number of elements in each set is given in brackets&period;

      p
        | The HTML pages for each Element hosted at the Open Metadata Registry&comma; maintain a balance between human-friendly and machine-friendly identifiers&comma; so you will see a mix
        | of identifiers with opaque numerics and more human readable labels&period; Documentation currently in preparation will
        | provide more explanation for these decisions and their intended utility&period; Note that the constrained elements are
        | related to their unconstrained versions so that data created in an RDA application can be re-used by a non-RDA
        | application&period;

        | If you discover a problem with the representations of the vocabularies&comma; or have a question&comma; or even wish to engage in a philosophical or practical discussion&comma; please

      h5 What&rsquor;s different from the previous version&quest;
      p
        | The work on a draft version began in 2008&comma; and since then a significant amount of discussion and learning has
        | occurred&period; The new RDA Vocabularies reflect that understanding&period;
      p
        | The draft version of the elements available at
        a(href='http://rdvocab.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdvocab&period;info
        | were never
        | officially published&comma; so those elements will be deprecated and users and applications redirected to the current
        | official versions at
        a(href='http://rdaregistry.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdaregistry&period;info
        | &period;
      h5 What about the RDA value vocabularies&quest;
      p
        | The RDA Value Vocabularies agreed by the JSC are published in the original namespace at
        a(href='http://rdvocab.info') http&colon;&sol;&sol;rdvocab&period;info
        | &period; The JSC has no plans to move them to the new namespace&comma; but
        | the situation will be reviewed in due course as part of the ongoing development of RDA documentation for users and
        | application developers&period; Any changes will be carried out with minimum disruption and will not affect the semantics
        | of the vocabulary concepts and terms&period;
      h5 Next Steps
      p
        | The JSC&comma; Metadata Management Associates &lpar;MMA&rpar;&comma; and the American Library Association Publishing division will
        | continue to collaborate on extensions and refinements of the RDA element sets and value vocabularies&period; Some
        | additional functionality will be added to the RDA Vocabularies as improvements are made in the OMR software&period; We
        | are always happy to discuss current and future requirements of users or potential users of the vocabularies&period;
